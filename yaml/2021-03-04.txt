  title: What is Retrospective Survey Harmonization?
  subtitle: Joining data from several, differently coded SPSS files.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Retrospective survey harmonization allows the comparison of opinion poll data conducted in different countries or time.  In this example we are working with data from surveys that were ex ante harmonized to a certain degree â€“ in our tutorials we are choosing questions that were asked in the same way in many natural languages.  For example, you can compare what percentage of the European people in various countries, provinces and regions thought climate change was a serious world problem back in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.
