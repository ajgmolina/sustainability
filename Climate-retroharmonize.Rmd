Retrospective survey harmonization comes with many challenges.  In this tutorial we cannot show all of them, but we can highlight the ones that are almost certain to show up:

-	Neither the number of observations or the number of variables (which represents the survey questions and their translation to coded data) is the same.  Certain data may be only present in one survey and not the other. This means that you will likely to run loops on lists and not data.frames.
-	The original files identifiers may not be unique. Weighting may not be straightforward.
-	Similar questions may be imported from a non-native R format, in our case, from an SPSS files, in an inconsistent manner.  SPSS’s variable formats cannot be translated unambiguously to R classes. `retroharmonize` introduced a new S3 class system that handles this problem, but eventually you will have to choose if you want to see a numeric or character coding of each categorical variable.
-	There are likely to be various types of `missing values`.  Working with missing values is probably where most human judgment is needed.  Why are some answers missing: was the question not asked in some questionnaires?  Is there a coding error?  Did the respondent refuse the question, or sad that she did not have an answer?   `retroharmonize` has a special labeled vector type that retains this information from the raw data, if it is present, but you have to make the judgment yourself – in R, eventually you will either create a missing category, or use `NA_character_` or `NA_real_`.
-	Same variables may come with dissimilar variable names and variable labels.  It may be a challenge to match age with age. We need to harmonize the names of variables. 
-	The harmonized variables may have different labeling.  One may call refused answers as `declined` and the other `refusal`.  On a simple choice, climate change may be ‘Climate change’  or `Problem: Climate change`. Binary choices may have survey-specific coding conventions. Value labels must be harmonized.
-	The harmonized surveys, with harmonized variable names and harmonized value labels, must be brought to consistent R representations (most statistical functions will only work on numeric, factor or character data) and carefully joined into a single data table for analysis.

That’s a lot to put on your plate.  It is unlikely that you will be able to work with completely unfamiliar survey programs if you do not have a strong intermediate level of R.  Our package comes with tutorials for Eurobarometer, Afrobarometer and Arab Barometer, highlighting some peculiar issues with these survey programs, that we hope to give a head start for less experienced R users. 

In this example, we will work with Eurobarometer’s data. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Please use the development version of [retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/):

```{r install-retroharmonize, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("antaldaniel/retroharmonize")
```

```{r load-pkg, message=FALSE}
library(retroharmonize)
library(dplyr)       # this is necessary for the example 
library(lubridate)   # easier date conversion
library(stringr)     # You can also use base R string processing functions 
```
## Get the Data

`retroharmonize` is not associated with Eurobarometer, or its creators, Kantar, or its archivists, GESIS. We assume that you have acquired the necessary files from GESIS after carefully reading their terms and you placed it on a path that you call gesis_dir.

```{r read-files, eval=FALSE}
#Not run in the blogpost. In the repo we have a saved version.
climate_change_files <- c("ZA5877_v2-0-0.sav", "ZA6595_v3-0-0.sav",  "ZA6861_v1-2-0.sav", 
                          "ZA7488_v1-0-0.sav", "ZA7572_v1-0-0.sav")

eb_waves <- read_surveys(file.path(gesis_dir, climate_change_files), .f='read_spss')

if (dir.exists("data-raw")) {
  save ( eb_waves,  file = file.path("data-raw", "eb_climate_change_waves.rda") )
}
```

```{r load-existing-data}
if ( file.exists( file.path("data-raw", "eb_climate_change_waves.rda") )) {
  load (file.path( "data-raw", "eb_climate_change_waves.rda" ) )
} else {
  load (file.path("..", "..",  "data-raw", "eb_climate_change_waves.rda") )
}
```

The `eb_waves` nested list contains five surveys imported from SPSS to the survey class of [retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html). The survey class is a data.frame that retains important metadata for further harmonization.

```{r wave-contents}
document_waves (eb_waves)
```

Beware the object sizes.  If you work with many surveys, memory-efficient programming becomes imperative. We will be subsetting whenever possible.

## Metadata analysis

As noted before, prepare to work with nested lists. Each imported survey is nested as a data frame in the `eb_waves` list. 

```{r metadata, echo=FALSE, messag=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
eb_climate_metadata <- lapply ( X = eb_waves, FUN = metadata_create )
eb_climate_metadata <- do.call(rbind, eb_climate_metadata)
```

## Protocol

Eurobarometer calls certain metadata elements, like interviewee cooperation level or the date of a survey interview as protocol variable.  Let's start here. This will be our template to harmonize more and more aspects of the five surveys (which are, in fact, already harmonizations of about 30 surveys conducted in a single 'wave' in multiple countries.)

```{r metadata-protocol}
# select variables of interest from the metadata
eb_protocol_metadata <- eb_climate_metadata %>%
  filter ( .data$label_orig %in% c("date of interview") |
             .data$var_name_orig == "rowid")  %>%
  suggest_var_names( survey_program = "eurobarometer" )

# subset and harmonize these variables in all nested list items of 'waves' of surveys
interview_dates <- harmonize_var_names(eb_waves, 
                                       eb_protocol_metadata )

# apply similar data processing rules to same variables
interview_dates <- lapply (interview_dates, 
                      function (x) x %>% mutate ( date_of_interview = as_character(.data$date_of_interview) )
                      )

# join the individual survey tables into a single table 
interview_dates <- as_tibble ( Reduce (rbind, interview_dates) )

# Check the variable classes.

vapply(interview_dates, function(x) class(x)[1], character(1))
```

This is our sample workflow for each block of variables.  Get an unique identifier, add other values, harmonize the variable names and subset by leaving out not harmonized variables.  Apply some normalization in a nested list. When the variables are harmonized to same name, class, merge them into a data.table-like tibble object.

Now finish the harmonization. `Wednesday, 31st October 2018` should become a Date type `2018-10-31`.

```{r protocol, message=FALSE}
require(lubridate)
harmonize_date <- function(x) {
  x <- tolower(as.character(x))
  x <- gsub("monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday|sunday|\\,|th|nd|rd|st", "", x)
  x <- gsub("decemberber", "december", x) # all those annoying real-life data problems!
  x <- stringr::str_trim (x, "both")
  x <- gsub("^0", "", x )
  x <- gsub("\\s\\s", "\\s", x)
  lubridate::dmy(x) 
}

interview_dates <- interview_dates %>%
  mutate ( date_of_interview = harmonize_date(.data$date_of_interview) )

vapply(interview_dates, function(x) class(x)[1], character(1))
```

To avoid duplication of row IDs in surveys that may not be unique in _different_ surveys, we created a simple, sequential ID for each survey, including the ID of the original file.

```{r}
set.seed(2021)
sample_n(interview_dates, 6)
```


After this type-conversion problem let's see an issue when an original SPSS variable can have two meaningful R representations.

## Geography 

Let's continue with harmonizing geographical information in the files. In this example, `var_name_suggested` will contain the harmonized variable name. It is likely that you have to make this call, after carefully reading the original questonnaires and codebooks.

```{r regmetadata}
eb_regional_metadata <- eb_climate_metadata %>%
  filter ( grepl( "rowid|isocntry|^nuts$", .data$var_name_orig)) %>%
  suggest_var_names( survey_program = "eurobarometer" ) %>%
  mutate ( var_name_suggested = case_when ( 
    var_name_suggested == "region_nuts_codes"     ~ "geo",
    TRUE ~ var_name_suggested ))

```

The  `harmonize_var_names()` takes all variables in the subsetted, geographical metadata table, and brings them to the harmonized `var_name_suggested` name. The function subsets the surveys to avoid the presence of non-harmonized variables. All regional NUTS codes become `geo` in our case:

```{r harmonize-geography-vars}
geography <- harmonize_var_names(eb_waves, 
                                 eb_regional_metadata)
```

If you are used to work with single survey files, you are likely to work in a tabular format, which easily converts into a data.frame like object, for example, to tidyverse's tibble.  However, when working with longitudinal data, it is far more simpler to work with nested lists, because the tables usually have different dimensions (neither the rows corresponding to observations or the columns are the same across all survey files.)

In the nested list, each list element is a single, tabular format survey. The regional information in the Eurobarometer files is contained in the `nuts` variable.  We want to keep both the original labels and values. The original values are the region's codes, and the labels are the names. The easiest and fastest solution is the base R `lapply` loop.

```{r process-geography-vars}
geography <- lapply ( geography, 
                      function (x) x %>% mutate ( region = as_character (geo), 
                                                  geo    = as.character(geo) )  
)

```

Because each table has exactly the same columns, we can simply use `rbind()` and reduce the list to a modern `data.frame`, i.e. a `tibble`. 

```{r join-geography-vars }
geography <- as_tibble ( Reduce (rbind, geography) )
```

Let's see a dozen cases: 

```{r check-geography-vars}
set.seed(2021)
sample_n(geography, 12)
```

The idea is that we go similar variable block by block, and eventually we will join them togehter.  Next step: socio-demography and weights.

## Demography

We will harmonize the socio-demographic variables and weight variables next.  There are a few peculiar issues to look out for. This example shows that survey harmonization requires plenty of expert judgment, and you cannot fully automate the process. 

The Eurobarometer archives do not use all weight and demographic variable names consistently.  For example, the `wex` variable, which is a projected weight for the country's 15 years old or older population is sometimes called `wex`, sometimes `wextra`.  

The `suggest_var_names()` function has a parameter for `survey_program = "eurobaromater"` which normalizes a bit the most used variables. For example, all variations of wex, wextra wil be noramlized to wex. You can ignore this parameter and use your own names, too. 

```{r demography-metadata}
eb_demography_metadata  <- eb_climate_metadata %>%
  filter ( grepl( "rowid|isocntry|^d8$|^d7$|^wex|^w1$|d25|^d15a|^d11$", .data$var_name_orig) ) %>%
  suggest_var_names( survey_program = "eurobarometer")
```

As you can see, using the original labels would not help, because they also contain various alterations.

```{r}
eb_demography_metadata %>%
  select ( filename, var_name_orig, label_orig, var_name_suggested ) %>%
  filter (var_name_orig %in% c("wex", "wextra") )
```
```{r harmonize-demography-vars}
demography <- harmonize_var_names ( waves = eb_waves, 
                                    metadata = eb_demography_metadata ) 
```

Socio-demographic variables like level of highest education or occupation are rather country-specific.  Eurobarometer uses standardized occupation and marital status scales, and a proxy for education levels, age of education leave. This is a particularly tricky variable, because it's coding in fact contains three different variables - school leaving age, except for students, and except for people who did not finish their compulsory primary school. 


```{r age-education}
example <- demography[[1]] %>%
  mutate ( across ( -any_of(c("rowid", "w1", "wex")), as_character) ) %>%
  mutate ( across (any_of(c("w1", "wex")), as_numeric) )
unique ( example$age_education )
```

```{r age}
unique ( example$age_exact)
```

There are a few strange values here.  We'll take care of them in a minute. Let's see all the strange labels attached to `age`-type variables.

```{r collect-val}
collect_val_labels(metadata = eb_demography_metadata %>%
                     filter ( var_name_suggested %in% c("age_exact", "age_education")) )
```
There are many exceptions to handle, so we create a function for this purpose.

```{r harmonize-demography}
remove_years  <- function(x) { 
  x <- gsub("years|and\\solder", "", tolower(x))
  stringr::str_trim (x, "both")}

process_demography <- function (x) { 
  
  x %>% mutate ( across ( -any_of(c("rowid", "w1", "wex")), as_character) ) %>%
    mutate ( across (any_of(c("w1", "wex")), as_numeric) ) %>%
    mutate ( across (contains("age"), remove_years)) %>%
    mutate ( age_exact = as.numeric (age_exact)) %>%
    mutate ( is_student = ifelse ( tolower(age_education) == "still studying", 
                                   1, 0), 
             no_education = ifelse ( tolower(age_education) == "no full-time education", 1, 0)) %>%
    mutate ( education = case_when (
      grepl("studying", age_education) ~ age_exact, 
      grepl ("education", age_education)  ~ 14, 
      grepl ("refus|document|dk", tolower(age_education)) ~ NA_real_,
      TRUE ~ as.numeric(age_education)
    ))  %>%
    mutate ( education = case_when ( 
      education < 14 ~ NA_real_, 
      education > 30 ~ 30, 
      TRUE ~ education )) 
}

demography <- lapply ( demography, process_demography )

## WE'll full join and not use rbind, because we have different variables in different waves.
demography <- Reduce ( full_join, demography )
```
```{r}
set.seed(2021)
sample_n(demography, 12)
```

## Harmonizing Variable Labels

And now let's turn to most important and most challenging bit of the problem. You are not harmonizing surveys to put together protocol or weighting variables.  You want to see harmonized answers from respondents in various surveys.

```{r}
climate_awareness_metadata <- eb_climate_metadata %>%
  suggest_var_names( survey_program = "eurobarometer" ) %>%
  filter ( .data$var_name_suggested  %in% c("rowid",
                                            "serious_world_problems_first", 
                                             "serious_world_problems_climate_change")
  ) 
```

```{r harmonize-climate-data}
hw <- harmonize_var_names ( waves = eb_waves, 
                            metadata = climate_awareness_metadata )
```

The `retroharmoinze` package comes with a generic harmonize_values function that will change the value labels of categorical variables (including binary ones) to a single format. It will also take care of various types of missing values.

```{r climate-labels}
collect_val_labels(climate_awareness_metadata)
```


In this case, we want to select `Climate change` as the mentioned most serious problem, and `Climate change` taken from a list of three serious problems. In the single choice case, when `Climate change` is mentioned, the alternative answer is labeled as `Not mentioned`. In the multiple choice case, the alternative may be `Spread of infectious diseases`, as we all well know.

We want to see who thought `Climate change` was the most serious problem, or one of the most serious problems, so we label each mentions of `Climate change` as `mentioned` and we pair it with a numeric value of `1`.  All other cases are labeled as `not_mentioned`, with the exceptions of various missing observations, which in this cases are `Do not know` answers, `Declined to answer` cases, and `Inappropriate` cases. This is Eurobarometer's label for questions that were for one reason or other not asked from a particular interviewee -- for example, because the Turkish Cypriot community received a different questionnaire.

```{r labelling}
# positive cases
label_1 = c("^Climate\\schange", "^Mentioned")
# missing cases 
na_labels <- collect_na_labels( climate_awareness_metadata)
na_labels
```

```{r labelling0}
# negative cases
label_0 <- collect_val_labels( climate_awareness_metadata)
label_0 <- label_0[! label_0 %in% label_1 ]
```

The `harmonize_serious_problems()` function harmonized the labels within the special labelled class of `retroharmonize`.  This class retains all information to give categorical variables a character or numeric representation, and various processing metadata for documentation purposes.  While this class is very reach (it contains whatever was imported from SPSS's proprietary data format and the history), it is not suitable for statistical analysis.  

```{r adopt-harmonization function}
harmonize_serious_problems <- function(x) {
  label_list <- list(
    from = c(label_0, label_1, na_labels), 
    to = c( rep ( "not_mentioned", length(label_0) ),   # use the same order as in from!
            rep ( "mentioned", length(label_1) ),
            "do_not_know", "inap", "inap", "inap"), 
    numeric_values = c(rep ( 0, length(label_0) ), # use the same order as in from!
                       rep ( 1, length(label_1) ),
                       99997,99999,99999,99999)
  )
  
  harmonize_values(x, 
                   harmonize_labels = label_list, 
                   na_values = c("do_not_know"=99997,
                                 "declined"=99998,
                                 "inap"=99999), 
                   remove = "\\(|\\)|\\[|\\]|\\%"
  )
}
```

First, let's remove the surveys that do not contain these world problem variables. In this cases, the subsetted and harmonized surveys in the nested list have only one columns, i.e. the `rowid`. 

```{r remove-empty}
hw <- hw[unlist ( lapply ( hw, ncol)) > 1 ]
```

Now we have a smaller problem to deal with.  With many surveys, it is easy to fill up your computer's memory, so let's start building up our joined panel data from a smaller set of nested, subsetted surveys.

```{r harmonized-waves}
hw <- lapply ( hw, function (x) x %>% mutate ( across ( contains("problem"), harmonize_serious_problems) ) )
```

We reduced our single and multiple choice questions to binary choice variables. We can now give them a numeric representation. Be mindful that `retroharmonize` has special methods for its special labelled class that retains metadata from SPSS. This means that `as_character` and `as_numeric` knows how to handle various types of missing values, whereas the base R `as.character` and `as.numeric` may coerce special values to unwanted results. This is particularly dangerous with numeric variables.

We will ignore the differences between various forms of missingness, i.e. the person said that she did not know, or did not want to answer, or for some reason was not asked in the survey. In a more descriptive, non-harmonized analysis you would probably want to explore them as various 'categories' and use a character representation. 

```{r join-waves, message=FALSE}
hw <- lapply ( hw, function(x) x %>% mutate ( across ( contains("problem"), as_numeric) ))

hw <- Reduce ( full_join, hw)
```

Let's see what we have: 

```{r joined-wave-sample}
set.seed(2021)
sample_n (hw, 12)
```

## Creating the Longitudional Table

```{r join-all-up, message=FALSE}
#start from the smallest (we removed the survey that had no relevant questionnaire item)
panel <- hw %>%
  left_join ( geography, by = 'rowid' ) 

panel <- panel %>%
  left_join ( demography, by = c("rowid", "isocntry") ) 

panel <- panel %>%
  left_join ( interview_dates, by = 'rowid' )
```

And let's see a small sample: 

```{r}
sample_n(panel, 12)
```

```{r save-to-tempdir}
saveRDS ( panel, file.path(tempdir(), "climate_panel.rds"), version = 2)
```

```{r copy-file, eval=TRUE}
# not evaluated
saveRDS( panel, file = file.path("data-raw", "climate-panel.rds"), version=2)
```

## Putting It on a Map

This is not the end of the story. If you put all this on a map, the results are a bit disappointing. 

```{r wrong-map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
if (file.exists("nuts2_2016.png")) {
  knitr::include_graphics("nuts2_2016.png")
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path("plots", "nuts2_2016.png"))
}

```

Why? Because sub-national (provincial, state, county, district, parish) borders are changing all the time - within the EU and everywhere. The next step is to harmonize the geographical information. We have another CRAN released package to help you with.  See the next post: [Regional Climate Change Awareness Dataset](https://rpubs.com/antaldaniel/regions-OOD21).
